Text:

- Subtitle: "Reduce mental overload"

Visual motif: a simple gauge/meter labeled "Load" with segments from low to high (no numbers). Keep most of it muted; highlight a single segment in #F97316.

"Cognitive load" is a fancy term for a simple experience:

**How much your working memory is holding at once.**

When cognitive load is too high, you feel it as:

- mental friction,
- rereading,
- silly mistakes,
- and rapid fatigue.

If you want the base concept first, read [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## Cognitive load theory in one minute

Your working memory is limited.

So learning and problem-solving depend on how much of that limited capacity is consumed.

A practical model is:

- **Intrinsic load**: the inherent difficulty of the material.
- **Extraneous load**: unnecessary complexity (bad instructions, distractions, messy tooling).
- **Germane load**: effort that actually helps learning (building mental models).

The best move is usually to reduce **extraneous** load first.

## Why cognitive load kills focus

When load is high, you can't keep the goal stable.

That makes distraction harder to resist, because your control system (executive function) has less to work with. See [Executive function explained](/blog/executive-function-explained).

## How to reduce cognitive load (practical)

### 1) Externalize steps

Write down:

- the next 3 steps,
- the definition you keep forgetting,
- or a quick checklist.

This is the fastest way to make hard tasks feel lighter.

### 2) Remove switching costs

Task switching is expensive because it forces you to rebuild context in working memory.

Batch messages and keep one task open during a focus block.

### 3) Chunk deliberately

If you're studying, chunking works best when you pair it with **active recall** (testing yourself), not rereading.

For a student-friendly routine, see [N-back for students](/blog/n-back-for-students).

### 4) Only then consider training

Training can help you practice control under load, but it doesn't replace good systems.

If you want a structured approach, n-back is one common option:
