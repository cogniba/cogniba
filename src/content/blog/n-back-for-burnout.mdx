IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "burnout" and "reset" (flat vector).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; keep all text inside an 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Burnout"
- Subtitle: "Train or rest?"

Visual motif: a simple battery icon half-empty next to a small reset/refresh arrow. Highlight only the arrow with #F97316.

If you’re burned out, your attention and working memory often feel unreliable.

So it’s natural to wonder: should you train n-back to “fix” focus?

Sometimes a small, well-calibrated session helps.

Sometimes it adds load and makes things worse.

This post gives a safer, practical approach.

## Burnout changes the training conditions

When you’re burned out, your effective capacity tends to be lower.

That looks like:

- more mind wandering,
- worse inhibition,
- and higher perceived effort.

This isn’t a character flaw. It’s a capacity and load issue.

Start with [Working memory capacity explained](/blog/working-memory-capacity-explained) and [Cognitive load theory explained](/blog/cognitive-load-theory-explained).

## When n-back can help

N-back can help if:

- you want a structured, short “focus warm-up”,
- you keep difficulty in a manageable band,
- and you stop before frustration spikes.

Use [N-back accuracy target](/blog/n-back-accuracy-target) and [How to set n-back difficulty](/blog/how-to-set-n-back-difficulty).

## When it can backfire

Be cautious if:

- you’re sleep deprived,
- you’re emotionally flooded,
- or you’re using training as self-punishment.

In these states, the best move may be rest and environment design.

See [How to improve your attention span](/blog/how-to-improve-attention-span).

## A safer burnout-friendly plan

If you still want to train, use this:

1. **Minimum session**: 5 minutes only.
2. **Lower difficulty** than usual.
3. **Stop while it’s still controlled.**

Your goal is “show up without adding stress.”

For a full schedule, see [N-back training schedule](/blog/n-back-training-schedule).

## Pair training with anti-burnout basics

Training is not a substitute for recovery.

Two high-leverage supports:

- reduce switching (less attention residue)
- externalize tasks (lower cognitive load)
