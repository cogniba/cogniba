IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "working memory capacity" (flat vector / UI panels).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; keep all text inside an 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Working Memory Capacity"
- Subtitle: "Your mental workspace size"

Visual motif: a container panel with 3-5 small blocks inside, with one block half-outside (overflow). Highlight only the overflow edge with #F97316.

Working memory capacity is the limit on how much information you can hold "online" at once.

When you hit that limit, focus feels fragile:

- you reread,
- you lose the thread,
- you make simple mistakes,
- and switching tasks becomes painful.

If you’re new to the concept, start with [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## Capacity, in plain language

Think of working memory as a desk.

Capacity is how much can fit on the desk before it becomes clutter and you start dropping things.

This is not about intelligence in a moral sense. It’s a system constraint.

## What affects working memory capacity day to day

Even if your baseline capacity is stable, your effective capacity changes with conditions.

Common reducers:

- **Sleep loss** (slower updating, more noise)
- **Stress / anxiety** (more intrusive thoughts)
- **Distraction** (attention constantly stolen)
- **High cognitive load tasks** (too many elements at once)

This is why [Cognitive load theory explained](/blog/cognitive-load-theory-explained) matters: lowering extraneous load gives you capacity back.

If rumination is eating your workspace, also see [N-back and anxiety](/blog/n-back-and-anxiety).

## “How many items can I hold?”

You’ll see different numbers in the literature because "item" depends on chunking.

In real life, what matters is this:

- You can hold a small number of chunks.
- Better chunking makes each chunk carry more meaning.

So the practical question becomes: how do you increase useful chunks (and reduce clutter)?

## How to work with limited capacity (fast wins)

### 1) Externalize steps

Write down the next 3 actions.

This is the single best hack for high-load work because it stops working memory from being your only storage.

### 2) Reduce switching

Switching burns capacity because you have to reload context.

If you constantly bounce, you’ll feel “stupid” even when you aren’t.

Start here: [Task switching explained](/blog/task-switching-explained) and [Attention residue explained](/blog/attention-residue-explained).

### 3) Use a “single sentence goal”

Before a focus block, write one sentence:

"In the next 60 minutes, I will **\_\_\_**."

That sentence keeps the goal stable, which supports [executive function](/blog/executive-function-explained) and makes [inhibitory control](/blog/inhibitory-control-explained) easier.

## Can you increase capacity?

Two layers:

1. **Support it** (sleep, stress management, environment).
2. **Train it** (practice updating and interference control).

If you want a broad, evidence-based set of levers, read [How to improve working memory](/blog/how-to-improve-working-memory).

If you want a training task, n-back is a common option:

- Start: [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task)
- Plan: [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back)
