If you're training n-back, it's normal to ask: **"When will I see results?"**

The most useful way to think about progress is in layers:

- Getting better at the task (almost guaranteed).
- Building consistency and attention control (very likely).
- Broad transfer to unrelated skills (possible, but not guaranteed).

If you want the basics first, read [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task).

## Week 1: the learning curve

In the first week, most improvement is about understanding the rules and reducing errors caused by confusion.

Common signs of progress:

- You stop feeling lost.
- You can hold the last n items without constant "resetting".
- Your accuracy stabilizes.

What to do:

- Keep sessions short (10-15 minutes).
- Don't chase difficulty.

Use [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## Week 2-4: consistency and stability

This is the phase where training becomes a habit and your performance becomes less noisy.

Common signs of progress:

- You can maintain focus for the full session.
- Your accuracy becomes more predictable day to day.
- You start noticing how sleep and stress affect performance.

What to do:

- Train 3-5 sessions/week.
- Increase difficulty only when stable.

If you feel stuck early, check [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).

## Week 5-8: incremental gains (and realism)

After the first month, progress tends to become slower and more incremental.

This is also where people start asking about "real-life" effects.

What to expect (the honest version):

- You will likely continue improving at n-back.
- You may notice better attention control in cognitively demanding situations.
- Large claims (like guaranteed IQ boosts) are not reliable.

For the balanced view of IQ claims, read [Does n-back increase IQ?](/blog/does-n-back-increase-iq).

For the bigger picture of brain-training transfer, read [Does brain training work?](/blog/does-brain-training-work).

## How to measure progress without fooling yourself

Track trends, not single sessions.

Good measures:

- Average accuracy per week.
- Highest stable difficulty (not a one-off).
- Consistency (how many sessions you completed).

Avoid:

- Judging by one amazing day.
- Judging by one terrible day.

## What to do when you plateau

Plateaus are normal.

Try one change at a time:

1. Improve environment (remove distractions).
2. Reduce session length (higher quality).
3. Stabilize difficulty for 1-2 weeks.

If you want a focus-specific approach, read [Can n-back improve focus?](/blog/n-back-for-focus).
