"When will it start working?"

This is the most common question we get at [Cogniba](/). While everyone's brain is different, we have enough data to construct a general timeline of what you can expect if you follow a [consistent schedule](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## Week 1: The "Brain Fog" Phase

- **What happens**: You are learning the interface and the rules. Your brain is working hard just to understand the task.
- **Feeling**: Frustration, mental fatigue, feeling "slow."
- **Real World**: No noticeable changes yet.

## Week 2-3: The Proficiency Phase

- **What happens**: You are no longer fighting the interface. You are engaging your [working memory](/blog/working-memory-explained) directly. You likely move from 2-Back to 3-Back.
- **Feeling**: "Flow" states during training.
- **Real World**: You might notice you can listen to a podcast while cooking and actually remember what was said.

## Week 4-5: The Transfer Phase

- **What happens**: Your n-back scores stabilize at a higher level.
- **Feeling**: Training feels like a workout, not a puzzle.
- **Real World**: This is where users report "clearer thinking." Complex tasks like coding, writing, or advanced math feel slightly less draining. Distractions are easier to ignore.

## Week 8+: The Consolidation Phase

- **What happens**: Long-term structural changes (neuroplasticity) are solidifying.
- **Feeling**: You have a new baseline of cognitive performance.
- **Real World**: [Fluid intelligence](/blog/fluid-intelligence-explained) gains are most likely to be measurable here.

Cognitive change is a marathon, not a sprint. Track your progress in your [dashboard](/app) and trust the process.
