IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "task switching" / "context switching" (flat vector).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Task Switching"
- Subtitle: "Context switching cost"

Visual motif: two overlapping window panels with a curved arrow between them and a small "residue" trail of muted dots. Highlight the arrow tip with #F97316.

Task switching is when you move from one task to another.

It feels productive ("I'm getting so much done"), but it often destroys real progress because each switch has a cost.

That cost is paid in **working memory**.

If you want the foundation, start with [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## What task switching really costs

When you switch tasks, your brain has to:

- drop the current context,
- load the next context,
- and rebuild the goal state.

Even if each switch is "only a minute", the hidden cost is loss of momentum and increased errors.

This is why deep work feels different: you stop paying the switching tax.

## Why it happens so easily

Two reasons:

1. Modern tools make switching frictionless.
2. Switching provides a quick hit of novelty.

This is where [inhibitory control](/blog/inhibitory-control-explained) matters: resisting the impulse to switch.

## How to reduce context switching (practical)

### 1) Batch communications

Pick two windows per day to check messages.

If you check continuously, you're building a switching habit.

### 2) Externalize the next step before you stop

Before you leave a task, write:

- the next action,
- the current hypothesis,
- and where to resume.

This makes re-entry dramatically faster.

### 3) Use "one task" blocks

Even 45 minutes helps.

If you're a programmer, this is especially important. See [N-back for programmers](/blog/n-back-for-programmers).

### 4) Train control under load (optional)

If you want a training task that pressures attention control, n-back is one option:

- [Can n-back improve focus?](/blog/n-back-for-focus)
- [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back)

Avoid the classic mistakes: [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).
