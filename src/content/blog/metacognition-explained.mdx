Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "metacognition" (flat vector / UI overlay).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; keep all text inside an 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Metacognition"
- Subtitle: "Thinking about thinking"

Visual motif: a main panel labeled "Task" with a smaller overlay panel labeled "Monitor" (like a HUD). Highlight the overlay outline with #F97316.

Metacognition is the skill of monitoring and adjusting your thinking.

It’s how you notice:

- “I’m confused and need a different approach,”
- “I’m overconfident,”
- or “I’m drifting and need to reset.”

It’s a quiet multiplier for learning and focus.

## What metacognition looks like in real life

Metacognition is present when you:

- stop rereading and test yourself instead,
- notice you’re guessing and slow down,
- or recognize you’re overloaded and externalize steps.

That last one connects directly to [Cognitive load theory explained](/blog/cognitive-load-theory-explained).

## Why it improves learning

Without metacognition, you can spend hours “studying” while staying confused.

With metacognition, you:

- detect confusion earlier,
- choose better strategies,
- and avoid wasting effort.

This matters because working memory is limited. See [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## How to build metacognition (practical)

### 1) Use tiny check-ins

During a focus block, ask:

- “What am I doing right now?”
- “What is the next step?”
- “What would count as done?”

If you can’t answer quickly, your goal isn’t stable.

That’s an executive function issue, not a motivation issue. See [Executive function explained](/blog/executive-function-explained).

### 2) Prefer active recall

Instead of rereading, test yourself.

Even one question forces you to reveal what you actually know.

### 3) Track confidence, not just correctness

After a session, write:

- what you got right,
- what you got wrong,
- and what you were confident about (but shouldn’t have been).

This calibrates learning faster than time spent.

### 4) Train attention control under load (optional)

Metacognition is easier when attention is stable.

If you want a structured task to practice goal maintenance, n-back is one option:

- [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task)
- [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back)

If you use it, keep difficulty calibrated: [How to set n-back difficulty](/blog/how-to-set-n-back-difficulty).
