IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "consistency" / "stay consistent" (flat vector / streak motif).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; keep all text inside an 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Consistency"
- Subtitle: "Don’t burn out"

Visual motif: a simple row of 7 small squares (streak) with 4-5 filled; highlight one filled square with #F97316 and keep others muted.

Most people don’t fail brain training because the task is ineffective.

They fail because they don’t stick with it long enough.

Consistency is the real advantage.

If you’re starting from scratch, read [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## Why consistency is hard

N-back is effortful.

And effortful activities fight three forces:

- busy schedules,
- low-energy days,
- and the temptation to “do something easier”.

That temptation is mostly [inhibitory control](/blog/inhibitory-control-explained).

## The consistency system (simple, reliable)

### 1) Reduce friction to near zero

Make starting easy:

- same time each day,
- same device,
- no decisions.

If you have to decide “when” and “how” every time, you’ll quit.

### 2) Use a minimum session

On bad days, do:

- 5 minutes.

This preserves the habit.

You can stop after 5 minutes with zero guilt.

Most days you’ll continue.

### 3) Keep difficulty in the sweet spot

If training feels punishing, you’ll avoid it.

Use:

- [N-back accuracy target](/blog/n-back-accuracy-target)
- [How to set n-back difficulty](/blog/how-to-set-n-back-difficulty)

The goal is “hard but controlled,” not “maxed out.”

### 4) Don’t train when you’re cognitively overloaded

If you’re already overloaded, training quality drops and motivation follows.

This is cognitive load in action. See [Cognitive load theory explained](/blog/cognitive-load-theory-explained).

If you still want to show up, do the minimum session and call it a win.

### 5) Track one thing

Pick one simple metric:

- sessions completed this week.

That’s it.

If you track everything, you create noise and lose motivation.

## A weekly template

- 4-5 sessions/week
- 10-20 minutes/session

If you want a full schedule, use [N-back training schedule](/blog/n-back-training-schedule).
