Brain training is full of bold claims.

Some programs help, many don't, and almost all marketing oversimplifies the science.

This post explains the key concept you need to evaluate claims: **transfer**.

## What is transfer?

Transfer is when training on one task improves performance on another task.

- **Near transfer**: improvement on very similar tasks.
- **Far transfer**: improvement on broader abilities (like general reasoning).

Near transfer is common. Far transfer is harder to demonstrate.

## Why most brain training programs fail

Many programs:

- train narrow tasks,
- measure improvement on similar tasks,
- then claim broad real-life benefits.

That doesn't mean training is worthless; it means claims should match evidence.

## What the evidence supports (the cautious version)

Large reviews suggest:

- You can improve on trained tasks.
- There may be some improvements on related measures.
- Broad "IQ increases" are not guaranteed.

If you're specifically interested in n-back and IQ, read [Does n-back increase IQ?](/blog/does-n-back-increase-iq).

## How to get value anyway

The productive way to use brain training is to pick a task that trains a skill you care about.

For example, n-back trains updating and interference control under load.

- Learn the task: [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task)
- Train with a routine: [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back)
- Avoid mistakes: [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes)

If your goal is focus, read [Can n-back improve focus?](/blog/n-back-for-focus).

If you want the underlying concepts:

- [Fluid intelligence explained](/blog/fluid-intelligence-explained)

## A better promise

The best promise is not "your IQ will go up".

The best promise is:

**"You can practice attention control and working-memory updating in a measurable way."**

That can support real-life performance when paired with good systems.
