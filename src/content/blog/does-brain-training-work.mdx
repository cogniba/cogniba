"Train your brain! Get smarter!"

You've seen the ads. Sudoku apps, crossword puzzles, and colorful mini-games all promise to sharpen your mind. But do they work?

The scientific consensus is: **mostly no.**

## The Problem of Transfer

If you do crosswords every day, you get very good at crosswords. But you don't get better at remembering your grocery list or focusing in meetings. This is a failure of **transfer**. You learned a specific skill, not a general cognitive ability.

## Why N-Back Is Different

The [n-back task](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) is different because it is **process-based**, not content-based. You aren't learning "tricks" or "facts." You are taxing the raw capacity of your **working memory system**.

Because working memory is used in _almost every cognitive task_ (reading, math, planning, conversation), improvements here have a much higher chance of transferring to real life.

## The Evidence

While not every study shows massive IQ gains, the literature consistently shows that n-back training improves:

1.  **Working Memory Capacity** (Near transfer)
2.  **Attention Control** (Far transfer)

Cogniba is built strictly on this evidence. No gimmicks, no "brain games." Just the hard work that leads to real adaptation.
