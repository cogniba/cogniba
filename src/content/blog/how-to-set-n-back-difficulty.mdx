IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "n-back difficulty" / "training sweet spot" (flat vector).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; keep all text inside an 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "N-Back Difficulty"
- Subtitle: "Find the sweet spot"

Visual motif: a simple bell curve or slider with three zones labeled "Too easy", "Sweet spot", "Too hard". Highlight only the middle zone with #F97316.

If your n-back training feels confusing, it’s often a difficulty problem.

The right level should feel effortful but manageable.

Too easy and you stop adapting. Too hard and you train frustration (or quit).

If you’re brand new, start with [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) and [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## What “difficulty” means in n-back

Difficulty is how hard it is to keep the correct target in working memory while resisting interference.

It usually increases when you:

- raise `n` (2-back -> 3-back),
- speed up stimuli,
- add a second modality (dual n-back),
- or reduce cues / increase similarity.

For the modality decision, see [Single vs dual n-back](/blog/single-vs-dual-n-back).

## The most useful metric: accuracy band

You don’t need perfect scoring.

You need an accuracy band that signals “challenge + control”.

Practical target:

- Aim to spend most sessions around **70-85%** accuracy.

Why:

- Above that, it often becomes too easy.
- Below that, working memory is overloaded and learning gets noisy.

This is basically cognitive load management. See [Cognitive load theory explained](/blog/cognitive-load-theory-explained).

## A simple rule for adjusting difficulty

Use a rolling window of recent blocks (or recent sessions).

1. If you’re consistently **> 85%**, increase difficulty slightly.
2. If you’re consistently **< 65-70%**, decrease difficulty slightly.
3. If you’re in the band, stay put and build consistency.

Small adjustments beat big jumps.

## Common mistakes

### Mistake 1: chasing the highest n

Higher `n` is not the goal.

The goal is training attention control and updating under load.

If you want the honest view on outcomes, read [Does brain training work?](/blog/does-brain-training-work).

### Mistake 2: changing settings every session

If you constantly change protocols, you never stabilize.

Pick a setup, run it for a week, then adjust.

See [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).

### Mistake 3: training when you’re fried

Sleep loss and stress reduce your effective working memory.

On low-energy days, you can reduce difficulty and still get a high-quality session.

This is also why [Executive function explained](/blog/executive-function-explained) and [Inhibitory control explained](/blog/inhibitory-control-explained) matter: self-regulation sets the conditions for good reps.

## A “good session” checklist

- You can stay engaged without zoning out.
- You make errors, but not constantly.
- You finish feeling challenged, not defeated.
