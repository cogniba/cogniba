IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "n-back training schedule" (flat vector / calendar motif).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; keep all text inside an 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Training Schedule"
- Subtitle: "Frequency beats intensity"

Visual motif: a simple 7-day grid with 4-5 squares filled, one highlighted in #F97316, the rest muted.

If you want results from n-back, the most important variable is consistency.

Not marathon sessions. Not “max difficulty”.

Just a schedule you can keep.

If you’re new, start with [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) and follow [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## How often should you train?

A solid default is:

- **4-5 days per week**
- **10-20 minutes per session**

This gives you enough exposure to adapt without turning it into a stressor.

## Why frequency beats intensity

N-back is attention control under load.

If you train too hard:

- accuracy collapses,
- frustration rises,
- and you stop showing up.

The schedule that you actually complete is the one that works.

If you’re unsure what “too hard” looks like, see [N-back accuracy target](/blog/n-back-accuracy-target) and [How to set n-back difficulty](/blog/how-to-set-n-back-difficulty).

## A simple 4-week schedule (repeatable)

Week 1-2:

- 4 sessions/week
- 10-15 minutes

Week 3-4:

- 5 sessions/week (if recovery is good)
- 15-20 minutes

This matches what many people can maintain alongside real work.

For expectation setting, see [N-back results timeline](/blog/n-back-results-timeline).

## When to schedule sessions

Your best time is when working memory is most stable.

Common options:

- **Morning** (before email/notifications)
- **Pre-work block** (as a warm-up)
- **Midday** (if mornings are chaotic)

If you train after a long day, difficulty may feel higher because effective capacity is lower. See [Working memory capacity explained](/blog/working-memory-capacity-explained).

## Rest days are part of training

Rest days prevent burnout and keep reps high quality.

If your attention feels fried, don’t force it.

Use the “minimum session” instead.

## The “minimum session” rule

If motivation is low, do:

- 5 minutes of n-back, then stop.

This preserves the habit.

Most people end up continuing once they start.

If you repeatedly dread training, read [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes) and reduce difficulty.
