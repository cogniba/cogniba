Working memory is your brain's "mental workspace". It is heavily involved in focus, learning, and reasoning.

If you want the concept explained clearly, start with [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

This post is a practical guide: what you can do that reliably helps, what is overhyped, and how to build a routine you can keep.

## 1) Reduce working-memory load (the fastest win)

Before you try to "increase" capacity, reduce the load.

Simple systems that work:

- Write the next 3 steps on a note.
- Use checklists for repeated workflows.
- Keep one task open at a time.
- Reduce interruptions (notifications off).

This often improves real-life performance more than any training.

## 2) Sleep (non-negotiable)

Sleep strongly affects attention and working memory.

If your sleep is unstable, n-back scores will be noisy and your day-to-day focus will feel fragile.

Practical steps:

- Keep a consistent wake time.
- Get morning light.
- Avoid late caffeine.

## 3) Exercise (one of the most reliable "brain boosters")

Regular aerobic exercise correlates with better cognitive function and mental health.

Practical minimum:

- 20-30 minutes, 3x/week.

## 4) Stress and rumination management

Stress consumes working memory.

If your mind is busy, your workspace is smaller.

If anxiety/rumination is part of the problem, read [N-back and anxiety](/blog/n-back-and-anxiety) (with realistic expectations).

## 5) Targeted training (n-back)

Once your basics are in place, you can add training.

N-back is a common choice because it forces updating and interference control.

Start here:

- [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task)
- [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back)

Avoid the pitfalls: [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).

## 6) Nutrition basics (keep it boring)

The best cognitive nutrition advice is usually not exotic supplements.

- Eat enough protein.
- Avoid large blood-sugar swings.
- Hydrate.

If you're sleep deprived, no supplement will outwork that.

## 7) Set realistic expectations

You can improve how you perform in demanding tasks by:

- reducing load,
- improving sleep,
- training attention control,
- building systems.

But be skeptical of guaranteed claims.

For the big picture on transfer and why many programs fail, read [Does brain training work?](/blog/does-brain-training-work).
