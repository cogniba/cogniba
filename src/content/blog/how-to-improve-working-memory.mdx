You want a faster brain. [N-back training](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) is the direct workout, but you can't out-train a bad lifestyle. To truly maximize your [working memory](/blog/working-memory-explained), you need a three-pronged approach.

## 1. Targeted Cognitive Training (The N-Back)

This is the heavy lifting. By dedicating 15-20 minutes a day to a task that specifically taxes your updating and interference control, you drive neuroplastic change. This is what [Cogniba](/pricing) provides.

## 2. Aerobic Exercise

Your brain needs oxygen and fuel. Research consistently shows that **aerobic exercise** (running, swimming, cycling) releases BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), a protein that supports neuron growth.

- **The Protocol**: 30 minutes of moderate cardio, 3x a week, has been shown to improve executive function.

## 3. Sleep

Sleep is when memory consolidation happens. Even mild sleep deprivation causes a massive drop in working memory performance. You cannot focus if your "RAM" wasn't cleared overnight.

- **The Protocol**: 7-8 hours of quality sleep. No exceptions.

## The Multiplier Effect

Doing one of these is good. Doing all three is transformative. Exercise primes the brain for growth, sleep locks in the gains, and n-back training provides the specific stimulus.
