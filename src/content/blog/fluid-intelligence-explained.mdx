Fluid intelligence (often abbreviated **Gf**) is the ability to solve new problems, reason, and spot patterns in unfamiliar situations.

It's different from **crystallized intelligence** (knowledge you've learned).

## Why Gf matters

Gf is strongly connected to:

- learning new skills,
- adapting to novelty,
- complex problem-solving.

It is also one reason people get interested in working-memory training.

Start with the foundation: [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## How fluid intelligence is measured

Gf is often measured using tasks that require pattern discovery and reasoning.

Examples include matrix reasoning problems (similar to Raven-like tasks) and other abstract reasoning measures.

Important: tests can be influenced by many factors (sleep, motivation, familiarity), so single measurements are noisy.

## How working memory relates to Gf

Working memory provides the "workspace" you use while solving problems.

When the workspace is overloaded:

- you lose intermediate steps,
- you make more errors,
- you get derailed by distractions.

That is one reason working memory and Gf correlate.

## Where n-back fits

N-back is a working-memory task.

The controversial question is whether training it improves Gf.

Read:

- [Does n-back increase IQ?](/blog/does-n-back-increase-iq)
- [Does brain training work?](/blog/does-brain-training-work)

If you want to try n-back in a practical way, use [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).
