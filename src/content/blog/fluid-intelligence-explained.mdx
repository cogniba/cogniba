Intelligence is not a single thing. Psychologists generally divide general intelligence (_g_) into two main components: **Crystallized Intelligence (Gc)** and **Fluid Intelligence (Gf)**.

Understanding the difference is key to understanding why we train.

## Crystallized Intelligence (Gc)

This is your database. It includes your vocabulary, facts about history, and learned skills like driving or coding syntax. It tends to _increase_ with age as you learn more.

## Fluid Intelligence (Gf)

This is your processor. It is the ability to:

- Solve **novel** problems you've never seen before.
- Identify patterns and relationships.
- Use logic in new situations.

Crucially, Gf typically peaks in your mid-20s and slowly declines.

## Can You Change It?

For a long time, scientists thought Gf was genetic and fixed. You were stuck with the processor you were born with.

However, research into neuroplasticity—and specifically [working memory training](/blog/does-n-back-increase-iq)—has challenged this view. Because working memory allows you to hold the pieces of a new problem in your head, improving it effectively upgrades your Gf.

In a rapidly changing world where "facts" (Gc) can be Googled in seconds, **Fluid Intelligence** is the ultimate competitive advantage. It's the ability to adapt.

Don't let your processor decline. [Keep it sharp with Cogniba](/).
