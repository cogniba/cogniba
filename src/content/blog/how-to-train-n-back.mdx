If you want n-back training to be useful, you need a plan that is **short**, **repeatable**, and **hard enough to matter** without being so hard that you quit.

This is a simple 4-week protocol you can follow.

If you want a quick overview of n-back first, read [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task).

## The goal of the plan

You're building two things:

1. A consistent training habit.
2. The ability to update working memory under pressure.

That means your main metric is not "highest level ever". Your main metric is **quality sessions per week**.

## Setup (once)

- Choose **single n-back** if you're new.
- Start at a level that feels challenging but doable (often 2-back).
- Train in the same environment (quiet, phone away).

If you're debating single vs dual, read [Single vs dual n-back](/blog/single-vs-dual-n-back).

## Week 1: consistency first

3-5 sessions.

- Duration: 10-15 minutes.
- Focus: form and accuracy.
- Rule: stop before you're mentally fried.

If you feel tempted to overdo it, read [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).

## Week 2: increase volume slightly

4-5 sessions.

- Duration: 15 minutes.
- Add one session where you push slightly harder (but not every session).

## Week 3: progress and track

4-6 sessions.

- Keep most sessions steady.
- 1-2 sessions: push difficulty.
- Track your accuracy and how you feel (sleep/stress matter).

## Week 4: consolidate (avoid the burnout trap)

4-6 sessions.

- The goal is to finish the month with momentum.
- If accuracy collapses, dial it back.

Read [N-back results timeline](/blog/n-back-results-timeline) for realistic expectations.

## How to progress the difficulty

Progression depends on the implementation, but the core idea is stable:

- If accuracy is high and steady, increase difficulty slightly.
- If accuracy is chaotic, keep difficulty stable and improve attention.

Avoid changing too many variables at once.

## Make it matter in real life

N-back is not magic. Combine it with work habits that reduce working-memory overload:

- Write steps down.
- Use a single-task workflow.
- Protect focus blocks.

Read [N-back for focus](/blog/n-back-for-focus) and [How to improve working memory](/blog/how-to-improve-working-memory).
