Consistency is king. You wouldn't expect to build muscle by going to the gym once a month. The same applies to brain training.

If you are serious about improving your [working memory](/blog/working-memory-explained) and focus, you need a routine. Here is a practical protocol based on successful research studies.

## The Protocol

- **Frequency**: 4 to 5 days per week.
- **Duration**: 15 to 20 minutes per session.
- **Length**: 4 to 6 weeks for noticeable results.

## Week 1: The Learning Phase

Your brain will struggle to understand the mechanics of the [n-back task](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) initially.

- **Goal**: Reach stable performance at 2-Back.
- **Tip**: Don't worry about "IQ" yet. Just try to get into a rhythm. If you get frustrated, take a break.
- **Mode**: Start with Single N-Back if Dual is too overwhelming.

## Week 2: The Push

Now that the mechanic is automatic, the real work begins.

- **Goal**: Push into 3-Back territory.
- **Feeling**: It should feel "comfortably uncomfortable." If you are getting 100% correct, it's too easy. Ideally, you want to hover around 75-85% accuracy so the system levels you up.

## Week 3: The Plateau

You might feel stuck. This is normal.

- **Goal**: Maintain consistency. Do not skip days.
- **Focus**: Try to notice if you are "chunking" (memorizing strings of items). Try to rely on pure updating instead.

## Week 4: Breakthrough

Many users report a "clicking" sensation where higher levels suddenly feel manageable.

- **Goal**: consistent 3-Back or entry into 4-Back.
- **Reflection**: Notice changes in daily life. Are you reading faster? Focusing longer?

## Tools

You need a tool that handles the tracking and difficulty adjustment for you. [Cogniba](/pricing) handles all of this automatically, giving you charts to see your Week 1 vs Week 4 gains.

Stick to the schedule, and the results will follow.
