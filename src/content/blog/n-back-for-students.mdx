Cramming doesn't work. Highlighting doesn't work. If you want to improve your grades, you need to improve the engine that processes information: your **working memory**.

## The Learning Engine

Learning is a two-step process:

1.  Hold new information in [working memory](/blog/working-memory-explained).
2.  Connect it to long-term memory.

If your working memory is full, step 2 never happens. This is why you can read a textbook page three times and recall nothing. Your buffer was overflowed.

## Why N-Back Helps Students

Training with [Cogniba](/)'s n-back tasks can help students in three specific ways:

### 1. Complex Reading Comprehension

Understanding dense academic text requires holding the beginning of a paragraph in mind while reading the end. A larger working memory makes this effortless.

### 2. Math and Science

Solving equations requires holding variables and intermediate steps in your head. N-back mimics this "holding and manipulating" process perfectly.

### 3. Exam Focus

Exams are high-stress environments. N-back training helps with **anxiety regulation** and maintaining focus under pressure.

## When to Train

For students, we recommend a "priming" routine. Do a short 10-minute session before you start studying. It wakes up your executive functions and gets you ready to absorb information.

Don't just study harder. Study with a sharper tool. [Try Cogniba for free](/sign-up).
