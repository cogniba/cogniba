N-back training is potent, but fragile. Because the brain is an efficiency machine, it will try to find "shortcuts" to do the task without actually using working memory. If you let it, you won't get the benefits.

Here are the top mistakes we see users make.

## 1. Chunking

This is the biggest enemy of progress. "Chunking" is when you memorize a string of sounds ("A, B, C...") and wait for them to repeat.

- **The Fix**: Focus on the _relationship_ between the current item and the n-back item. Treat it as a continuous stream, not a set of groups.

## 2. Prioritizing Speed Over Accuracy

Cogniba measures your accuracy to determine when to level you up. Rushing and guessing might feel fast, but it ruins the data and keeps you at a lower level than you're capable of.

- **The Fix**: Rhythm is better than speed. Stay calm.

## 3. Training While Distracted

You cannot train [working memory](/blog/working-memory-explained) while watching Netflix. The whole point is to max out your attentional capacity.

- **The Fix**: Treat your 15 minutes like a meditation session. Phone away, silence, full focus.

## 4. Inconsistency

Doing 1 hour once a week is worse than 10 minutes every day. Neural adaptation requires repeated, frequent stimulus.

- **The Fix**: [Follow our protocol](/blog/how-to-train-n-back). Set a daily reminder.

## 5. Staying in the Comfort Zone

It feels good to get 100% on 2-Back. It feels bad to struggle at 3-Back. But the struggle is where the growth happens.

- **The Fix**: Trust the [adaptive algorithm](/). If it pushes you up a level, you belong there. Embrace the failure.

Avoid these traps, and your training efficiency will skyrocket.
