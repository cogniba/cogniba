IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode programmer/deep-work themed social card (flat vector, no people).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "N-Back for Programmers"
- Subtitle: "Deep work + context switching"

Visual motif: a simple code bracket icon and a minimal terminal window outline, paired with a small 3x3 grid card. Add two subtle curved arrows to suggest switching contexts. Keep iconography thin and modern.

Programming taxes working memory.

When you're coding, you're holding:

- the current goal,
- the code path,
- variable meanings,
- edge cases,
- and the next step.

Then one interruption hits and the whole mental state collapses.

This is why "focus" for programmers is often about protecting working memory.

Start here: [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## How n-back can help (the honest version)

N-back trains attention control under load. It's not a productivity hack, but it can help you practice:

- sustained attention,
- updating mental state,
- resisting interference.

Read [Can n-back improve focus?](/blog/n-back-for-focus).

## A programmer-friendly routine

Use n-back as a short warm-up before deep work:

- 10-15 minutes n-back
- 60-120 minutes deep work

Then stop. The goal is to arrive at deep work with your attention "online".

Use [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## Workflow habits that protect working memory

The biggest gains usually come from environment + systems:

1. **Single-task**: one ticket, one repo, one branch.
2. **Externalize state**: write the next 3 steps in a note.
3. **Design for interruption**: leave a breadcrumb before you stop.
4. **Batch context switches**: check messages at fixed times.

If you train n-back while multitasking, you'll sabotage it. See [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).

## What to expect

You will improve at n-back. Transfer to real work is possible but not guaranteed.
