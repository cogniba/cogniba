Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is often characterized by deficits in **working memory** and **executive control**. It makes sense, then, that researchers have looked at [n-back training](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) as a potential intervention.

## The Link Between Working Memory and ADHD

People with ADHD often struggle to hold information in mind (working memory) and resist impulses (inhibition). Since the n-back task trains both, it theoretically targets the core cognitive deficits of ADHD.

## What the Studies Say

Research results have been mixed but promising:

- **Symptom Reduction**: Some studies show a reduction in inattentive symptoms after intensive training.
- **Less "Transfer"**: While performance on the task improves, transfer to real-world organization skills varies from person to person.
- **Complementary Tool**: Most experts agree that brain training works best alongside other interventions (medication, therapy, lifestyle changes), not as a standalone cure.

## How to Use It

If you have ADHD, the biggest challenge with n-back is **boredom**. The task is repetitive.

- **Gamification**: This is why [Cogniba](/)'s design is crucial. We use progress tracking and leveling to keep the dopamine flowing.
- **Short Bursts**: 15 minutes is plenty. Don't try to hyperfocus for an hour; you'll burn out.

Think of n-back as "attention push-ups." It strengthens the muscles you use to control your focus, making it easier to direct your attention where you want it to go.

[Try a session](/sign-up) and see if it helps you regain control.
