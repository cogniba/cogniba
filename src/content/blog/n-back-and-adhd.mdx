Important: this post is educational, not medical advice.

ADHD is a clinical condition that can affect attention regulation, impulsivity, and executive function. If you think you may have ADHD, consider speaking with a qualified professional.

## Why people connect ADHD and n-back

N-back is a working-memory task that stresses:

- sustained attention,
- interference control,
- rapid updating.

Those are all skills that often feel difficult for people with attention challenges.

If you're new to the task itself, start with [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task).

## What the evidence says (in plain language)

Working-memory training can improve performance on the tasks you practice (near transfer). Broader improvements are less consistent.

That does not mean training is useless, but it does mean you should have realistic expectations.

Read the balanced overview: [Does brain training work?](/blog/does-brain-training-work).

## A safer way to try n-back if you have attention challenges

If you want to experiment with n-back:

1. Keep sessions short (10 minutes).
2. Train 3-4 times/week.
3. Use a distraction-free environment.
4. Track how it affects you (motivation, stress, sleep).

Use [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back) and focus on consistency.

If your goal is focus, start with [Can n-back improve focus?](/blog/n-back-for-focus).

## What not to do

- Don't replace evidence-based treatment or supports.
- Don't overtrain to the point of frustration.
- Don't treat one bad session as proof it doesn't work.

If you want broader working-memory tactics (not just training), read [How to improve working memory](/blog/how-to-improve-working-memory).
