Sustained attention is the ability to keep focus on one task for an extended period.

It’s what you need for:

- deep reading,
- complex problem solving,
- and work that requires keeping a goal stable.

If you struggle with shorter focus cycles, start with [How to improve your attention span](/blog/how-to-improve-attention-span).

## Sustained attention vs “trying harder”

Sustained attention isn’t pure willpower.

It’s a combination of:

- working memory capacity,
- inhibitory control,
- and environment design.

If your mental workspace is overloaded, sustained attention collapses. See [Working memory capacity explained](/blog/working-memory-capacity-explained) and [Cognitive load theory explained](/blog/cognitive-load-theory-explained).

## Why sustained attention breaks

Common failure modes:

- **distraction exposure** (easy switching)
- **attention residue** from unfinished tasks
- **high cognitive load** without external supports
- **fatigue** (sleep + stress)

If you’re constantly switching, read [Task switching explained](/blog/task-switching-explained) and [Attention residue explained](/blog/attention-residue-explained).

## How to build sustained attention (practical)

### 1) Reduce switching opportunities

Make the default path “stay on task”.

- phone out of reach
- notifications off
- one-tab rule during focus blocks

This reduces how often you have to spend [inhibitory control](/blog/inhibitory-control-explained).

### 2) Use focus blocks

Sustained attention is easier inside a boundary.

Try:

- 45-90 minutes of single-task work
- 5-10 minutes break

### 3) Lower cognitive load

If your task has many moving parts, externalize steps.

Write down:

- the next 3 actions,
- key variables,
- and open questions.

This protects working memory.

### 4) Train control under load (optional)

If you want to practice keeping a goal active while resisting interference, n-back is one option.

- [Can n-back improve focus?](/blog/n-back-for-focus)
- [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back)

To keep sessions in the right zone, use [N-back accuracy target](/blog/n-back-accuracy-target).

## What progress looks like

Progress is usually:

- fewer “breaks” in the first 30 minutes,
- faster return after interruption,
- and less mental drag.

If you want a realistic timeline, see [N-back results timeline](/blog/n-back-results-timeline).
