The Holy Grail of cognitive science is finding a way to increase **fluid intelligence (Gf)**—the ability to reason and solve new problems independently of previously acquired knowledge. For decades, IQ was thought to be fixed.

Then came the **n-back task**.

## The Jaeggi Study (2008)

In 2008, Susanne Jaeggi and her colleagues published a study that shook the field. They showed that participants who trained on the **Dual N-Back** task for just a few weeks showed significant improvements in matrix reasoning tasks—a standard measure of fluid intelligence.

Crucially, the improvement was **dose-dependent**: the more they trained, the more their Gf improved.

## The Debate

Since then, the topic has been hotly debated. Some replication studies found similar results, while others found smaller effects or no transfer to IQ at all.

Why the discrepancy?

1.  **Motivation**: Participants who are motivated and engaged (like those using a gamified app vs. a dry lab tool) tend to see better results.
2.  **Challenge**: The training _must_ be adaptive. If it's too easy, no growth occurs.
3.  **Measurement**: Different studies use different IQ tests.

## Realistic Expectations

So, does [Cogniba](/)'s training increase IQ?

The most consistent finding is that n-back training reliably increases **working memory capacity**. Since working memory is highly correlated with fluid intelligence (some researchers argue they share a neural capacity), improving one often benefits the other.

Think of it like weightlifting for the brain. Squats might not directly teach you how to play football, but having stronger legs makes you a better player. Similarly, a stronger [working memory](/blog/working-memory-explained) supports better reasoning, reading comprehension, and problem-solving.

Don't expect to become a genius overnight. But do expect to feel sharper, more focused, and better equipped to handle complex mental tasks.
