People often ask some version of: **"Does n-back increase IQ?"**

It's a fair question, and the honest answer is more nuanced than most marketing claims.

## First: what do people mean by "IQ" here?

When research talks about IQ improvements from training, it's usually talking about **fluid intelligence** (often abbreviated **Gf**) rather than memorized knowledge.

Fluid intelligence is the ability to solve new problems, spot patterns, and reason in unfamiliar situations.

If you want the concept explained clearly, read [Fluid intelligence explained](/blog/fluid-intelligence-explained).

## What n-back training reliably improves

N-back is a working-memory task. The strongest, most consistent effects are:

- Better performance on the n-back task itself.
- Improvements on very similar working-memory tasks ("near transfer").

This fits with how working memory works as a limited mental workspace. If you haven't yet, read [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## What the evidence suggests about IQ / Gf

Early studies reported transfer from n-back training to measures of fluid intelligence. Later work and reviews emphasized that:

- Results vary a lot by study design.
- Some effects shrink when methods get stricter.
- Many programs show near transfer but limited far transfer.

Meta-analyses and broad reviews provide a more balanced picture than any single study.

## A realistic expectation (the useful framing)

Instead of asking "Will my IQ go up?", a more actionable question is:

**"Will I get better at sustaining focus and updating information under pressure?"**

That is much closer to what n-back actually trains. Those skills can matter in real life (studying, complex work, high-distraction environments), even if your IQ test score doesn't move.

For a broader discussion of transfer and why most brain-training claims fail, read [Does brain training work?](/blog/does-brain-training-work).

## How to maximize your odds of meaningful improvement

If you want the best chance of benefits beyond "getting good at the game":

1. **Train consistently** (habit beats intensity).
2. **Progress slowly** (avoid constant overreaching).
3. **Track accuracy** (don't chase level).
4. **Keep sessions short** (10-20 minutes).

Use the practical routine here: [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

Also consider combining training with basics that strongly affect cognition: sleep, exercise, and stress control. See [How to improve working memory](/blog/how-to-improve-working-memory).
