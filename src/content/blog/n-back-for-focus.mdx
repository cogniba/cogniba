IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode focus-themed social card (flat vector).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "N-Back for Focus"
- Subtitle: "Attention control under load"

Visual motif: a central focus dot or ring with a soft orange glow (#F97316) and faint reticle lines. Background shapes should be blurred/low-contrast in #1E293B and #94A3B8, becoming sharper near the center.

"Focus" is not one thing. Sometimes it means resisting distractions. Sometimes it means holding a goal in mind. Sometimes it means recovering quickly after an interruption.

N-back can help with one specific piece of focus: **attention control while working memory is loaded**.

If you're new to the task, read [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task).

## The focus skill n-back trains

In n-back, you are forced to:

- Keep a small amount of information active.
- Update it every trial.
- Ignore interference from similar items.

That combination is closely related to what many people experience as "staying on task".

For the core concept behind this, see [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## What n-back will not fix

It will not automatically solve:

- Chronic sleep deprivation.
- A chaotic environment.
- Constant notifications.
- Unclear goals.

N-back is training, not a replacement for basic focus hygiene.

## How to use n-back specifically for focus

The goal is not maximum difficulty. The goal is a short session where you practice clean attention.

Try this:

1. Train 10-15 minutes.
2. Immediately do 45-90 minutes of deep work.
3. Keep the same environment for both.

This helps you build a ritual: "focus session" followed by "work session".

Use the full protocol here: [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## Common focus-related mistakes

If you're doing n-back for focus, avoid these:

- Training while half-distracted.
- Training too long.
- Chasing level when accuracy collapses.

See [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).

## A simple focus stack (n-back + environment)

To make any cognitive training more effective:

- Remove the phone.
- Use one tab.
- Write a 1-sentence goal for the next work block.
- Externalize steps (checklist) so working memory stays free.
