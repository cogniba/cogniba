We live in an economy of distraction. Notifications, open tabs, and background noise constantly vie for your attention.

While you can try to remove distractions, you can also **armor your brain** against them. This is where [n-back training](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) shines—specifically through a mechanism called **interference control**.

## The Mechanism of Focus

Focus isn't just about looking at one thing; it's about actively _suppressing_ everything else.

In the n-back task, you must constantly:

1.  **Encode** the new item.
2.  **Match** it against an old item.
3.  **Inhibit** (ignore) the items in between that are no longer relevant.

This constant inhibition is a workout for your brain's **executive control network**.

## The Transfer to Daily Life

When you train your brain to filter out "irrelevant n-back items," you are also training it to filter out:

- The conversation at the next desk.
- The urge to check your phone.
- The wandering thought about dinner.

## Evidence

Research shows that high working memory capacity is strongly correlated with the ability to maintain attention in "noise." By expanding your [working memory](/blog/working-memory-explained), you effectively widen your mental bandwidth, making it harder for distractions to derail you.

If you find yourself constantly tab-switching or losing your train of thought, 15 minutes of n-back might be the reset button you need.
