IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "n-back accuracy target" (flat vector / chart).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; keep all text inside an 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Accuracy Target"
- Subtitle: "Don’t chase 100%"

Visual motif: a simple horizontal bar labeled 0% to 100% (no tick labels except endpoints), with a highlighted mid-range band (70-85%) in #F97316.

If you’re doing n-back and wondering “what score should I aim for?”, the surprising answer is:

Not 100%.

Perfect accuracy usually means the task is too easy to drive adaptation.

If you’re new, read [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) and follow a routine from [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## Why accuracy matters

Accuracy is a proxy for how much load you’re putting on working memory and attention control.

- Too high: not enough challenge.
- Too low: overload, sloppy reps, frustration.

This mirrors the idea in [Cognitive load theory explained](/blog/cognitive-load-theory-explained): learning works best when load is high enough to be meaningful but not chaotic.

## A practical accuracy target

For most people, a good working band is:

- **70-85% accuracy** for most blocks/sessions.

If your system reports accuracy differently (hits/false alarms), aim for a similar “mostly correct but not perfect” band.

## What to do if you’re above the band

If you’re consistently above ~85%:

- increase difficulty slightly,
- or increase speed slightly,
- or (later) consider dual n-back.

For modality choices, see [Single vs dual n-back](/blog/single-vs-dual-n-back).

## What to do if you’re below the band

If you’re consistently below ~65-70%:

- lower difficulty,
- slow down,
- shorten the session,
- or train earlier in the day when you have more mental energy.

If anxiety/rumination is interfering, see [N-back and anxiety](/blog/n-back-and-anxiety).

## The most common trap: changing everything

If you change protocol every session, your data becomes meaningless and motivation drops.

Keep the setup stable for a week, then adjust.

This is one of the core points in [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).

## If you want a single rule

Aim to finish sessions thinking:

“That was hard, but I stayed in control.”

That feeling is closely linked to executive control. See [Executive function explained](/blog/executive-function-explained) and [Inhibitory control explained](/blog/inhibitory-control-explained).
