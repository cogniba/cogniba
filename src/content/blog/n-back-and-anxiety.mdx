Anxiety is complex, and treatment decisions should be made with qualified professionals. That said, many people are curious about whether attention and working-memory training can help with **rumination** and **intrusive thoughts**.

## Why anxiety can feel like a focus problem

One way anxiety shows up is as repeated attention capture:

- your mind returns to the same worry,
- you replay scenarios,
- you struggle to disengage.

That is partly emotional and partly cognitive (attention control and working-memory load).

Start with the basics: [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## What n-back might help with

N-back trains a narrow skill: keeping a goal active and updating it while resisting interference.

In that sense, n-back may support the cognitive side of "getting unstuck" from distractions.

If your goal is attention control, read [Can n-back improve focus?](/blog/n-back-for-focus).

## What n-back will not do

N-back is not a treatment for anxiety disorders.

If you are experiencing significant anxiety symptoms, a better first step is evidence-based support and professional care.

## A gentle way to experiment

If you want to try n-back without turning it into another stressor:

- Train 8-12 minutes.
- Keep difficulty stable.
- Stop the session if frustration spikes.

Use the low-friction plan in [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back) and avoid overreaching (see [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes)).

## If rumination is the real problem

Rumination and intrusive thoughts are common across many people, even without a diagnosis.

The key skill is often not "removing" thoughts, but changing your relationship to them and improving your ability to redirect attention.

For the broader "does training transfer" question, read [Does brain training work?](/blog/does-brain-training-work).
