IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode social card about "attention span" (flat vector).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Attention Span"
- Subtitle: "Focus longer"

Visual motif: a subtle timer ring (no numbers) around a focus dot/reticle. Keep it calm and minimal; add one #F97316 highlight on the ring.

If you feel like your attention span is getting worse, you're not imagining the incentives around you.

But the fix is rarely "try harder".

Attention is a system: cues, environment, working memory load, and habits.

This post gives you practical levers that reliably help.

## What "attention span" really is

Most people mean one of these:

- **Staying on task** (resisting distraction)
- **Returning to task** quickly after interruption
- **Sustaining effort** on mentally heavy work

All three depend on your mental workspace. Start with [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## Step 1: make distraction harder

This is not cheating. It's good design.

- Phone out of reach.
- Notifications off during focus blocks.
- One-tab rule for the task.

If you don't change the environment, you're depending on [inhibitory control](/blog/inhibitory-control-explained) all day.

## Step 2: reduce cognitive load

When working memory is overloaded, attention collapses.

Use the basics:

- Write the next 3 steps down.
- Keep a short checklist for repeated workflows.
- Break tasks into a first 5-minute action.

See [Cognitive load theory explained](/blog/cognitive-load-theory-explained).

## Step 3: use "focus blocks" not "endless sessions"

Most people do better with a protected block:

- 45-90 minutes work
- 5-10 minutes break

The goal is high-quality focus, not endurance.

## Step 4: consider targeted training

If you want to practice attention control under load, n-back is one option.

- [Can n-back improve focus?](/blog/n-back-for-focus)
- [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back)

Don't make it harder than it needs to be. Read [N-back training mistakes](/blog/n-back-training-mistakes).

## The simplest attention routine

If you want a low-friction start:

1. 10 minutes n-back (focused)
2. 60 minutes deep work
3. 10 minutes break

Repeat 1-2 cycles.
