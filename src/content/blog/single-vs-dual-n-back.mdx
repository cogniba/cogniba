If you're new to n-back training, the first decision you run into is whether to train **single n-back** or **dual n-back**.

They look similar, but they feel very different. The best choice is the one you can practice consistently.

## Quick definitions

- **Single n-back**: one stream of information (e.g., position on a grid).
- **Dual n-back**: two streams at the same time (often position + sound/letter).

If you want a full explanation of how the task works, start with [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task).

## What each one tends to stress

Both versions train working-memory **updating** and **interference control**, but dual n-back increases the load because you must manage two streams at once.

- Single n-back often feels like "one hard thing at a time".
- Dual n-back often feels like "two medium-hard things plus coordination".

If you're also learning the concept of working memory, read [Working memory explained](/blog/working-memory-explained).

## Pros and cons

### Single n-back

Pros:

- Easier to learn and measure (cleaner feedback).
- Lower burnout risk (you can build a habit).
- Great for dialing in form: pacing, focus, and accuracy.

Cons:

- Some people find it repetitive.
- If you only ever do single, you may miss the motivation that comes from novelty.

### Dual n-back

Pros:

- High engagement for many people.
- Trains coordination under load (two streams).
- Can feel more "complete" once you have the basics.

Cons:

- Easier to overreach and quit.
- More day-to-day variance (sleep, stress, and distraction hit harder).

## Which should you choose?

Use this simple decision rule:

1. If you're starting out, train **single n-back** for 1-2 weeks to build consistency.
2. If you're consistent and want a bigger challenge, test **dual n-back**.
3. If dual makes you inconsistent, go back to single.

Consistency beats intensity.

## A practical progression

Here is a low-friction way to progress without burning out:

- Weeks 1-2: single n-back (short sessions).
- Weeks 3-4: introduce dual 1-2 sessions/week.
- Keep most sessions at a level where accuracy stays meaningful.

Use the full routine here: [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## What about IQ improvements?

Dual n-back became popular partly because early studies suggested transfer to tests of fluid intelligence. The broader "brain training" literature is mixed, and it's better to approach this with realistic expectations.

- [Does n-back increase IQ?](/blog/does-n-back-increase-iq)
- [Does brain training work?](/blog/does-brain-training-work)

If you want the strongest case for why Cogniba focuses on single n-back mechanics, see [research](/research).
