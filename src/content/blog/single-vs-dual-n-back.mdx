When diving into cognitive training, you'll quickly encounter two main variations of the n-back task: **Single N-Back** and **Dual N-Back**. Both are effective, but they challenge your brain in slightly different ways.

Which one is right for you? Let's break down the differences and the science.

## Single N-Back: The Architecture of Focus

In a **Single N-Back** session, you track just one stream of information. Usually, this is visual—a square appearing in different locations on a grid.

- **Pros**: It allows for "pure" focus on the updating process of working memory. It is often less frustrating for beginners.
- **Cons**: It creates a lower cognitive load compared to Dual N-Back.
- **Best for**: improving concentration, [introductory training](/blog/how-to-train-n-back), and specific interference control.

See our [deep dive on Single N-Back research](/research) for more details.

## Dual N-Back: The Multitasking Challenge

**Dual N-Back** requires you to track _two_ independent streams simultaneously—typically a visual position and an auditory letter. You must match the position _n_ steps back AND the letter _n_ steps back.

- **Pros**: This places a massive load on your **working memory** and central executive. This version was used in the famous Jaeggi (2008) study that linked training to increased IQ.
- **Cons**: It is extremely difficult and can be discouraging.
- **Best for**: Maximum cognitive load, expanding total working memory capacity, and those seeking the classic "IQ boost" protocol.

## Which Is Better?

Recent meta-analyses suggest that **both** forms of training lead to improvements in working memory. The key factor isn't necessarily "single vs. dual," but **adaptive difficulty**.

Whether you choose Single or Dual, the training _must_ get harder as you improve. If you stay at 2-Back forever, you won't see gains. You need to push to 3-Back, 4-Back, and beyond.

At Cogniba, we support adaptive algorithms for both. We recommend starting with Single N-Back to master the mechanic, then graduating to Dual N-Back for the ultimate mental workout.
