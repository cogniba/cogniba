IMAGE PROMPT (1200x630 PNG):

Create a clean, minimal dark-mode "mental workspace" social card (flat vector / UI panels).
Color palette (use these exact hex values; subtle gradients allowed):

- Background: #020817 (optionally gradient to #0F172A)
- Surface/panels: #1E293B
- Text: #F8FAFC
- Muted text: #94A3B8
- Accent orange: #F97316 (use for small highlights)
- Accent orange-dark: #C2410C (optional)
- Optional accent blue: #3B82F6 (use sparingly)

Typography: bold modern sans-serif, high contrast.
Layout: generous padding; 80px safe margin.
Do not include any logos or brand names. No people, no photos, no watermark.

Text:

- Headline: "Working Memory"
- Subtitle: "Your brain's mental workspace"

Visual motif: a central dark panel with 3 floating cards (notes) and simple line icons (grid, text lines, checkbox). Use #F97316 as a subtle glow or small highlight on one card.

Working memory is the mental workspace you use to **hold information in mind and work with it**.

It's what lets you:

- Follow a multi-step instruction.
- Do mental math.
- Keep a sentence in mind while reading the next one.
- Stay on track when something tries to distract you.

If you ever feel "I know what I'm doing, but I can't keep it all in my head", you're feeling the limits of working memory.

## Working memory vs short-term memory

People sometimes use these terms interchangeably, but a helpful distinction is:

- **Short-term memory**: briefly holding information.
- **Working memory**: holding information and manipulating it (updating, comparing, reorganizing).

That "working" part is why it is strongly tied to focus and problem-solving.

## The classic model (in plain language)

One influential model describes working memory as a system with multiple parts:

- A control system that directs attention (often called the "central executive").
- A verbal store (sounds/words).
- A visual/spatial store (locations, shapes).
- A way to bind information together (the "episodic buffer").

You don't need the jargon to benefit from the idea: working memory is not one thing, and tasks can stress it in different ways.

## Why working memory matters for focus

Distraction isn't only about willpower. When your working memory is overloaded, you lose track of the goal, and distractions win by default.

This is why some focus strategies work so well:

- Reduce simultaneous tasks.
- Externalize steps (notes/checklists).
- Create a low-distraction environment.

## Can you improve working memory?

There are two practical paths:

1. **Support it** with lifestyle + systems (sleep, exercise, stress, external tools).
2. **Train it** with tasks that force updating and interference control.

If you're looking for a broad set of tactics, see [How to improve working memory](/blog/how-to-improve-working-memory).

If you want a targeted training task, n-back is a common choice.

## How n-back relates to working memory

N-back forces you to keep a moving window of information in mind and continuously update it.

- If you're new, start with [What is the n-back task?](/blog/what-is-n-back-task).
- If you want a routine, use [How to train n-back (4-week plan)](/blog/how-to-train-n-back).

## A simple self-check: is your working memory overloaded?

Try this quick test during your day:

- If you keep rereading the same paragraph, your working memory may be saturated.
- If you lose track mid-task after an interruption, you're hitting a capacity limit.

When you notice it, the fix is often to reduce load (write down steps) rather than "try harder".

## Try Cogniba

If you want structured n-back training with progress tracking:

## Working memory in real life (quick examples)

Working memory is the bottleneck in a lot of modern work:

- If you're studying, see [N-back for students](/blog/n-back-for-students).
- If you code for a living, see [N-back for programmers](/blog/n-back-for-programmers).
- If you're dealing with rumination loops, see [N-back and anxiety](/blog/n-back-and-anxiety).
