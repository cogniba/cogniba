You use it when you calculate a tip in your head. You use it when you remember a phone number just long enough to type it in. You use it when you read a complex sentence and need to remember the beginning by the time you reach the end.

It is **working memory**, and it is arguably the most important cognitive faculty you possess.

## What Is Working Memory?

Psychologists define working memory as a limited-capacity system for **temporarily holding** and **processing** information. It is distinct from short-term memory (which just holds info) because working memory involves _manipulation_.

Think of it as your brain's mental scratchpad or the RAM in your computer.

## Why It Matters

Working memory capacity is a strong predictor of:

- **Academic Success**: It correlates with reading comprehension and mathematical ability.
- **Professional Performance**: It helps with multitasking, planning, and complex problem-solving.
- **Focus**: A strong working memory helps you keep your goal in mind and resist distractions.

## The Bottleneck

The problem? The scratchpad is small. Most people can only hold about 4 to 7 "chunks" of information at once. When your working memory is full, you can't process anything else. This is why you feel overwhelmed when too many people talk at once or when a task gets too complex.

## Can You Upgrade It?

Yes. [N-back training](/blog/what-is-n-back-task) is specifically designed to expand this bottleneck. By constantly forcing you to update the contents of your working memory (dropping the old _n_, adding the new _n_), you train the neural networks responsible for this function.

Expanding your working memory capacity is like upgrading the RAM in your brain. Everything runs a little smoother.
