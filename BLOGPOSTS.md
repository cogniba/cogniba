- If a similar post exists, update that post or choose a clearly different angle.
- When you publish a post, add it to the "Published" list (one line per post).

## Published

- 2025-02-25 `welcome-to-cogniba` (`src/content/blog/welcome-to-cogniba.mdx`): Product intro; what Cogniba is and how science-backed N-Back training helps.
- 2025-02-26 `cogniba-launch` (`src/content/blog/cogniba-launch.mdx`): Launch announcement; Cogniba uses the n-back task to improve working memory and IQ.

## Backlog (Ideas)

Use these as "unique angles" to generate high-volume posts without repeating yourself.

Pillars (write once, keep updated):

- `what-is-n-back-task`: What the n-back task is, how it works, and why it is used in research.
- `single-vs-dual-n-back`: Single vs Dual N-Back, what studies say, and which to train.
- `does-n-back-increase-iq`: Evidence review (meta-analyses) and realistic expectations.
- `working-memory-explained`: Working memory basics and how it affects learning and focus.
- `how-to-train-n-back`: A practical 4-week protocol (15-20 min sessions) + common mistakes.

Supporting topics (one clear query each):

- `n-back-training-mistakes`: Common mistakes that ruin results (chunking, inconsistency, speed vs accuracy).
- `n-back-results-timeline`: What changes after 1 week / 4 weeks / 8 weeks of training.
- `n-back-for-focus`: How n-back trains attention control and distraction resistance.
- `n-back-for-students`: Study performance, working memory load, and how to practice.
- `n-back-for-programmers`: Deep work, context switching, and working memory in coding.
- `n-back-and-adhd`: What research suggests, what it does not, and safe expectations.
- `n-back-and-anxiety`: Working memory, rumination, and cognitive control (avoid medical claims).
- `how-to-improve-working-memory`: Evidence-based methods (training, sleep, exercise) + what to avoid.
- `fluid-intelligence-explained`: What Gf is, why it matters, and how it is measured.
- `does-brain-training-work`: What "transfer" means and why most apps fail.
